The project aims to design and implement a feasible parallel implementation of the Jacobi iterative method to solve a system of linear
equations. The proposed solution has been implemented using the parallel programming 
framework [FastFlow](https://github.com/fastflow/fastflow) and targeting the Intel Xeon PHI r720-phi
coprocessor.
